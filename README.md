Dead Simple COnfiguration management and continuous integration for linux like systems

DISCO is just now beginning development. Expect what you find here to do irreparable damage
to any system you run it on. I ONLY run disco on a throwaway VM at current.

Why disco?
=====

Because puppet, chef, cfengine, etc, are all great tools, but they all fall
short of the mark, in terms of simplicity, ease of use, and reliability.
None of them really follow the UNIX philosophy of "do one thing, do it well,
and don't reinvent the wheel".

No, really, why did you name it "disco"?
=====
I wanted an acronym based off of "Dead Simple Continuous Integration", and this was
the closest I found.

Requirements
=====

DISCO assumes that you:

    - have at least one server capable of running rsyncd, sshd and a recent GNU
    - have one or more clients capable of running ssh, rsync, fuse-unionfs, and recent GNU

While that's a very simple requirements list, it currently restricts it to recent Linux
systems. You may or may not be able to use this tool on FreeBSD or Mac OS X, I haven't
tried. Due to the way it executes, this tool will probably never, ever execute properly
on Windows.

Installing DISCO
=====

    1. Check out the sources
    2. sudo make install

Why focus so much on linux?
=====

Because if we try to do everything and the kitchen sink, for every OS out there, we run
the risk of falling short in the same ways the other CI tools have. By limiting our scope
and problem space to recent GNU/Linux systems, we can write a much simpler tool in a
much shorter amount of time that is much simpler to understand.

Is DISCO noop friendly (report all incoming changes)?
=====

Yes, DISCO is noop friendly, with a caveat: The way we implement noop is through restricted bash
shells. This is generally sufficient, and already proven and simple. 

There are some questions around "is the NOOP really secure then?" Well, yes and no. 
The disco NOOP, like any (bash --restricted) shell, can be broken out of without a whole lot of work.
Especially considering that the restricted shell runs as root. In this case, the disco NOOP,
much like a barbed wire fence at a buffalo farm, is not expected to ACTUALLY keep anyone inside -
it's just a gentle suggestion that you please not run all over the farm breaking things. 

Unlike puppet's noop, which is implemented via a guaranteed safe DSL, DISCO assumes an
existing trust network between your disco server and disco client; the goal of DISCO noop is to
prevent well-meaning trusted sysadmins from accidentally doing stupid things. It does not try
to secure your systems from malicious code. That security layer is moved up, onto the maintainer,
who must verify the sanity of all code they are sending to client machines.

Specifically: Since DISCO use a unionfs and chroot for the restricted bash shell, I am confiden
that your physical disk is safe from accidental modifications (everything is captured on the
scratchpad, with the exception of writes to /proc and /sys, which are read-only and simply discarded).
The bit that I can't promise is that one of your module maintainers won't find a way to kill a
running process, or signal/restart a service in a way that DISCO can't trap/log/noop it. 
This may or may not be a big deal to you, but should be a consideration before you start 
migrating to DISCO - how much do you trust your module maintainers?


How do you establish the trust relationship?
=====

DISCO uses rsync(+ssh) with SSH keys, so the answer is, "we don't establish it" - SSH handles
that for us by the server allowing or denying the key.

How do you handle parameters (like puppet ENC, etc)?
=====

DISCO uses a section of the filesystem to layout a tree of pathable, walkable parameters.
This part of the filesystem is available to the client at execution time, so these variables
can be used in scripts, templates, and definition files, to further customize execution based
off of parameters. This lives on the SERVER, not the client.

From the server perspective, the parameters tree looks like:

    /var/disco/parameters
    ___ ___ disco
    ___ ___ ___ client
    ___ ___ ___ ___ cmds
    ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ rsync
    ___ ___ disco
    ___ ___ ___ server
    ___ ___ ___ ___ uri
    ___ ___ NODE_NAME
    ___ ___ ___ modules
    ___ ___ ___ ___ ...
    ___ ___ ___ parameters
    ___ ___ ___ ___ ...

Think of it like a large JSON document expressed as a filesystem, with the document keys the
filenames, and the values being their contents. This format was chosen because it can be easily
created from any number of other existing datasources, and doesn't tie DISCO to any one particular
tool (cobbler, etc). The admin is free to create this structure on the server however they please.

Given this, disco does not use a config file, all configuration parameters are present in this
tree.

There are only two possible toplevel paths, /disco and /NODE_NAME. NODE_NAME is equal to the
FQDN of the client making a request, and /disco is the internal client/server configuration.
The parameter tree is transmitted from the server to the client via (yet another) rsync
operation, and is accessible as a filesystem tree (or the disco-param command which is just a
bash wrapper). These parameters appear in /var/disco/parameters on the client and server, and 
default values can be found there in the client/server install before the first run of the client.

    disco/client/cmds/rsync : The rsync command to use when synching
        files.
    disco/server/uri : The rsync URI from which to fetch module definitions.
    disco/NODE_NAME/modules : This list defines the modules to install 
        on a given node. 
    disco/NODE_NAME/parameters : This tree defines all configuration 
        parameters for the node not related to any module in particular.

Some special parameters are provided to the client, that do not exist on the paramters tree until
runtime:

    disco/NODE_NAME/current_module : This parameter defines the full 
        name of the current module, such that a module definition file 
        can access its personal parameters via without knowing its name, e.g.:
        $(disco-param get $(hostname)/classes/$(disco-param get $(hostname)/current_module)/some/module/specific/path)

How to deploy stuff
=====

DISCO uses rsync(+ssh) to distribute files, and bash to execute supporting scripts. It has a
rudimentary dependency mechanism implemented via a topological sort. 

Essentially, to deploy something, you need 3 things:

    - some static files on an rsync server
    - some bash templates (scripts that output what their content should be) on an rsync server
    - some scripts that may or may not do something with those files and templates

Scripts
=====

DISCO uses bash for a scripting and templating engine. Instead of writing a custom DSL that lets
you specify operations (like Puppet did) or utilize a higher level language (like Chef did with
ruby), DISCO just uses the proven bash shell. 

Every time your module is executed (e.g. every time the disco client executes), all of the scripts
are executed. The order of execution is determined by alphabetically sorting the filenames, rc.d
style; so naming your scripts as 00-fix_perms.sh, 10-correct_nodes.sh, etc, will cause them to be
executed in the proper order. This prevents you from having to create a separate file that describes
the execution order.

Files vs Templates
=====

Files and Templates are delivered exactly the same way - via rsync.

Files are static files who are delivered on to the disk, and no more operations are done to them.
They are delivered with the same permissions that they are given by the rsync repository.

Templates are bash scripts who are delivered on to the disk, and then they are executed, with their
file contents replaced by their output. Templates are subject to all the same restrictions as scripts
(be mindful of the constraints of $NOOP), and in addition, they are ALWAYS interpolated in the safe
NOOP execution environment (file modifications will be discarded, and only rudimentary bash builtins
are enabled). Templates have access to all client parameters via the disco-param command. Templates
will end up with the same permissions that rsync gives them.

Module Layout
=====

A disco module (also called a "disco ball" for fun) looks like this:

    MODULE
    ___ requires
    ___ parameters
    ├── files/
    ├── scripts/
    └── templates/

Your module can theoretically pull files, scripts, and templates from any location that can be
reached via rsync; however, it is generally considerd good form to include all things relevant
to your module, inside its disco ball. The disco ball is then placed in an accessible location
on the rsync server, and the disco client will pull all modules, files, scripts, and templates
relevant to its execution, and run them.

ALL MODULE FILES, SCRIPTS, AND TEMPLATES ARE DELIVERED RELATIVE TO / ON THE CLIENT.

MODULE/requires
=====

This file lists, one name per line, the names of other modules that must be installed on this
node in order for this module to install correctly. This is used to create a dependency graph,
and thereby determine execution order.

This file is optional.

MODULE/parameters
=====

Each module can define default parameters which will be made available to all clients using the module.
These parameters will be merged together on the client at module fetch time, and any node-specific
parameters will override any default parameters specified here (they are rsync'ed over the top of each
other). These parameters will be rooted at /MODULE_NAME/... .

This tree is optional.

Server Side Setup
=====

The only server side setup required for DISCO is to setup an rsyncd and sshd server. This is outside
the purview of this README. 

We would recommend setting up the rsync server to allow your DISCO clients (which MUST run as root),
to come in on a non-priveleged, non-root account. You can still use rsync's module definitions with
non-root users by setting up ~/.rsyncd in that user's home directory, and adding
"--rsh 'ssh -l USER_NAME'" to your /disco/client/cmds/rsync parameter on the clients. This will
allow you to specify your rsync locations in your module definitions as USER@HOST::MODULE_NAME instead
of having to specify a filesystem path, will give you all the benefits of an SSH key trust relationship,
and no concern of incoming root access to the server. (Note that this also prevents the often mysterious
and troublesome SSL certificate issues associated with other CI systems.)

Performance Metrics
=====

DISCO stores performance metrics for pretty much everything it does. Use 'disco report' to see them. 
The report generated will represent the times and statistics for the most recent disco dance.

The Gory Details ("how does it work?")
=====

DISCO is a work in progress so not all of it is complete, but the general idea is this:

    - DISCO client rsyncs its node configuration parameters from the server
    - DISCO client performs topological sort of required modules, and for each one:
        - fetch all files, templates and scripts
        - resolve all templates
            - resolve all templates
        - execute all scripts
        - report all differences
    - report overall success or failure (any piece of any module failing indicates failure)

DISCO is able to easily report all differences by executing all scripts and templates inside a 
restricted bash chroot, and on top of a read-only unionfs with a scratchpad on the top,
some custom twiddly bits in the middle, and the existing running filesystem at the bottom (read-only). 
The scratchpad is not merged if there is a failure during live (non-NOOP) execution, to prevent
from locking the system in a non-functioning state.

If the NOOP flag is set, then all the same operations are performed, but the restricted
environment stops all potentially dangerous commands at the reporting level (presumably), and
the fetched files are not merged out of the scratchpad onto the live filesystem. 

See the client disco-fs-* and disco-exec-* scripts for more information on how this is done.

A complete example
=====

Presume we have a server with an incoming user, "disco", who has a home directory like this:

    disco@server:~$ cat rsyncd.conf
    [parameters]
    path = /home/disco/parameters
    read only = true
    comment = DISCO Parameters
    list = yes
    use chroot = false
   
    [testmodule-1.0]
    path = /home/disco/modules/testmodule-1.0
    read only = true
    comment = v1.0 of the Test module
    list = yes
    use chroot = false
   
    [othermodule-3.2]
    path = /home/disco/modules/othermodule-3.2
    read only = true
    comment = v3.2 of othermodule
    list = yes
    use chroot = false 

    disco@server:~$ find parameters
    parameters
    parameters/localhost.localdomain
    parameters/localhost.localdomain/parameters
    parameters/localhost.localdomain/parameters/something
    parameters/localhost.localdomain/modules
    parameters/localhost.localdomain/modules/othermodule-3.2
    parameters/localhost.localdomain/modules/testmodule-1.0
  
    disco@server:~$ cat parameters/localhost.localdomain/parameters/something
    LOLTHISKEYMEANSNOTHING
  
    disco@server:~$ find modules
    modules
    modules/othermodule-3.2
    modules/othermodule-3.2/requires
    modules/othermodule-3.2/parameters
    modules/othermodule-3.2/parameters/othermodule-3.2
    modules/othermodule-3.2/scripts
    modules/othermodule-3.2/templates
    modules/othermodule-3.2/templates/etc
    modules/othermodule-3.2/templates/etc/othermodule
    modules/othermodule-3.2/templates/etc/othermodule/stuff.cfg
    modules/othermodule-3.2/files
    modules/testmodule-1.0
    modules/testmodule-1.0/requires
    modules/testmodule-1.0/parameters
    modules/testmodule-1.0/parameters/testmodule-1.0
    modules/testmodule-1.0/scripts
    modules/testmodule-1.0/scripts/00-hello.sh
    modules/testmodule-1.0/scripts/10-service_stop.sh
    modules/testmodule-1.0/templates
    modules/testmodule-1.0/files
   
    disco@server:~$ cat modules/othermodule-3.2/templates/etc/othermodule/stuff.cfg
    echo HOST=$(hostname)
    echo KEY_VALUE=$(cat /var/disco/parameters/$(hostname)/parameters/something)
  
    disco@server:~$ cat modules/testmodule-1.0/scripts/00-hello.sh
    #!/bin/bash
  
    echo "Hello, disco"
  
    disco@server:~$ cat modules/testmodule-1.0/scripts/10-service_stop.sh
    #!/bin/bash
  
    service postgresql stop

... and that we have, on our client, a disco parameters tree set up like this:

    [disco@client disco]$ disco-param dump
    disco = {}
    disco/client = {}
    disco/client/cmds = {}
    disco/client/cmds/rsync = rsync -qaWHe "ssh -i /home/disco/.ssh/id_rsa_disco"
    disco/server = {}
    disco/server/uri = disco@aklabs.net

... Then we can use disco to configure our host.

First we need to mount and initialize disco's testing/noop filesystem as
root on the client.

    [root@localhost disco]$ NOOP=true disco-fs-mount
    [root@localhost disco]$ NOOP=true disco-fs-init

This will take a minute or two, the init does a lot of work. (But you only
have to run the init once at system start, no matter how many times you 
run disco.) Now we can do our noop run:

    [disco@localhost disco]$ NOOP=true disco dance
    error: othermodule-3.2: rsync: link_stat "/files/*" (in othermodule-3.2) failed: No such file or directory (2)
    error: testmodule-1.0: rsync: link_stat "/files/*" (in testmodule-1.0) failed: No such file or directory (2)
    info: Processing testmodule-1.0
    Hello, disco
    warning: Would execute : service postgresql stop
    info: Processing othermodule-3.2
    info: File: file: /etc/othermodule/stuff.cfg : Created : type=[regular file] device=[fd00] mode=[81a4] selinux=[?] md5=[77b20e4840b1be13a577e152edc6b443] perms=[root:root 644]
    0a1,2
    > HOST=localhost.localdomain
    > KEY_VALUE=LOLTHISKEYMEANSNOTHING

Here we can see the noop at work; it is preventing potentially destructive
commands like 'service' from running, while allowing other harmless commands
to operate in the noop context so that script logic is not affected. We can
also see the highly detailed statistics and diffs returned for file 
modifications. But none of the files actually wind up present on the 
system, and no running processes were affected:

    [root@client ~]$ ps ax | grep -i postgresql
    15595 pts/1    S+     0:00 grep -i postgresql
    24457 ?        S      0:12 /usr/lib/postgresql/8.4/bin/postgres -D /var/lib/postgresql/8.4/main -c config_file=/etc/postgresql/8.4/main/postgresql.conf
    [root@client ~]$ ls -l /etc/othermodule/stuff.cfg
    ls: cannot access /etc/othermodule/stuff.cfg: No such file or directory

If we were to turn the NOOP flag off, this would all happen for real:

    [root@client disco]$ disco dance
    error: othermodule-3.2: rsync: link_stat "/files/*" (in othermodule-3.2) failed: No such file or directory (2)
    error: testmodule-1.0: rsync: link_stat "/files/*" (in testmodule-1.0) failed: No such file or directory (2)
    info: Processing testmodule-1.0
    Hello, disco
    info: Processing othermodule-3.2
    info: File: file: /etc/othermodule/stuff.cfg : Created : type=[regular file] device=[fd00] mode=[81a4] selinux=[?] md5=[77b20e4840b1be13a577e152edc6b443] perms=[root:root 644]
    0a1,2
    > HOST=localhost.localdomain
    > KEY_VALUE=LOLTHISKEYMEANSNOTHING

... And we will see that the config file has been installed:

    [root@client ~]$ cat /etc/othermodule/stuff.cfg
    HOST=localhost.localdomain
    KEY_VALUE=LOLTHISKEYMEANSNOTHING

... And that postgres has been stopped:

    [root@client ~]# ps ax | grep -i postgresql
    28394 pts/1    S+     0:00 grep -i postgresql

Hooray!

Disco will report other types of file modifications, as well. If you were to 
open an interactive shell in the disco chroot, and perform some more interesting
operations, representing what a more advanced sort of script might do:

    [disco@client disco]$ NOOP=true disco-sh-shell
    [root@client /]# rm -f /etc/passwd
    [root@client /]# grep -v root /etc/shadow | tee tmpfile

... Since that was done inside of the noop shell (where all the scripts and 
templates run during noop), we can easily report on these activities:

And here we see some more of Disco's rather extensive noop reporting capabilities.

But let's say that this run took longer than we thought it should. What was taking
so much time? Disco will tell us.

    [root@disco ~]# disco report
